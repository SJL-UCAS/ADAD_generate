ADAD:
This repository contains codes for generating the 500 m Agricultural Drought Impacted Area Dataset in the Main Grain-Production Area of China (ADAD). The dataset can be downloaded at: https://zenodo.org/records/15201953.

There provides an example of the evaluation and extraction of the agricultural drought impacted areas in Hunan Province. The agricultural drought impacted area of other provinces are extracted by the same code.

Evaluation_of_different_thresholds.m :
This code is used to evaluate the accuracy between the historical agricultural drought impacted areas and the simulated areas extracted by different thresholds in different phenological periods.

Agricultural_drought_area_extraction :
This code is used to extract the agricultural drought impacted areas by the determined thresholds in key phenological periods.
